This is a little bit of a retrospective post, and a little bit of a resolution
post. It feels quite gauche to me to catalog accomplishments, but I also
believe that it's really important to take a moment to appreciate what I've
worked on, and future me will benefit from the record. Also I spend most of my
time thinking about things I've done wrong, so writing this was a welcome
change.

<hr>

I had a really productive year! I released a [trio album of
standards](https://jefffowler.bandcamp.com/album/jeff-fowler-trio), something
I've been wanting to do since I was 16 years old. I released an [EP with Megan
and Toby](https://tobyjeffandmegan.bandcamp.com/album/cleveland), that we made
on Toby's and my trip to Cleveland last winter. We're trying to do that again
this year, hopefully!

At work at Etsy, I ticked off the 2 year mark, and moved from feeling like a
rank novice to feeling like I genuinely contribute more than I take. I have my
amazing coworkers to thank for much of that. We shipped big projects, and the
team grew, too! I also got the chance to rotate on an infrastructure team,
seeing a whole different side of our stack than I usually do.

I wrote 32 (!) blog posts, more than any other year by far, for a total of
81,375 words. That's like a 200 page book! (Or a 500 page book, in 14 point
double spaced comic sans, anyway, at least according to this [totally legit
website](http://wordstopages.com/) that I'm sure is completely accurate...)

Most of those posts were about [Sild](/sild-is-a-lisp-dialect/), the lisp that
I "finished" writing this year after 3 attempts. I learned _so much_ from that
project... I learned about lisps, and I learned about C and compilers and
memory allocation and a bunch of other things, and I started to learn about how
to express technical concepts in prose. That project was the biggest, hardest
thing I've done so far, and I can honestly say it levelled me up in a _ton_ of
ways, both obvious and subtle.

I wrote more and about more things this year than I ever have before in my
life, and I feel like for maybe the first time, I've developed a prosaic voice,
and a writing workflow. And people actually _read_ what I wrote! Sild was on
[the front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11842776),
and though I have my issues with the orange website, I can't deny that it was
thrilling to see the enormous spike in traffic, from all over the world, and I
was pleased that the comments were generally positive and even helped me
understand some things I was struggling with.

Writing so much helped me zero in on what and how I like to write! It turns out
I really enjoy writing _extremely procedurally detailed_ posts about projects
I've worked on. I don't want to position myself as an expert, I just want to be
_very thorough_ and genuine and clear about what I did and what I learned doing
it and why and how! I feel like there is a _lot_ of pedagogical value to that
perspective and voice, and I'd like to continue working on it.

Oh and Sofie and I got a cat!  And it turned out to be an _awesome cat_,
that loves laps. If you want a cat in New York, check out [Anjellicle
Cats](http://www.anjelliclecats.com/)... they work with [Koneko Cat
Cafe](https://www.konekonyc.com/), which is where we found Cara.

2017
=====

Some things I am thinking about trying to do this year:

Redefine my relationship with creativity.
---------------------------------------

This is funny, because this was actually my [first post](/v-i-2/) and my
resolution in 2013. I succeeded, wildly, but in a way I could never have
anticipated, because that was the year I started learning to program, just a
few months after posting that photo. (It was on wordpress before I ported it.)

I guess you could say this is an ongoing process, but concretely it means for
me this year figuring out how exactly I want to fit creativity and art and
music into my life. Music used to be the _only_ thing I did, basically. Now
it's one of many things I do. That's a good thing! I feel much more balanced
and healthy! But not performing and teaching professionally means that if I
want to continue to improve on what I know and create music then I'll have to
be much more intentional about it. The [same goes for
photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeywithamirror), something I used
to really enjoy but have let languish for years now as other pursuits filled up
my time.

It's not a given that I'll keep these things in my life, I may become too
swamped with other ambitions to keep my guitar chops up, or I might decide I
just don't have the energy to pursue photography anymore at all. But I don't
want to just let things happen to me, I want to remain _intentional_ about how I
spend my time.

That said,

Make and listen to more music
---------------

This is an easy one. I want to continue to make music, and more of it. I have
more specific thoughts on what that might mean and how that might look but they
aren't especially relevant right now, and will likely change.

I want to listen to more music and more actively listen to music, especially my
friends' music. I know how hard they've worked on it, and I have some extremely
talented friends! I'm also very lucky that as a programmer I have an enormous
amount of multitaskable time in my day to day that can include music, I ought
to be more picky about what I listen to while wrangling javascript or whatever.

Fill some gaps in my education in earnest
-----------------------------------------

As a "self taught" engineer (I have issues with that term, but you know what I
mean...) with an MM in Music and a BA in English, it's almost a given that I'll
lack quite a bit of knowledge when it comes to teh computings. But as I enter
my (almost) fourth year as a programmer (holy shit), I've actually filled in
quite a great many of those gaps. I feel pretty confident in what I know, now,
especially considering how recently I've come to the field, but the flipside to
that is that I really do appreciate what I still don't know, and oh sweet
little baby Jesus is there a lot of it.

There are a plenty of things that a traditional CS education provides that I
simply won't run into that often in my day to day. Algorithms and data
structures are the canonical examples, they're useful in my work sometimes, and
occasionally make a _very big_ difference in the performance of some task or
application I might be working on, but I could just as easily stumble through a
web development career with the essentially cursory understanding of them that
I have right now. And in any case, I have experienced coworkers to ask when that
kind of thing comes up, right? Sure, now, most of the time. But they're not always
going to be around! And someday I would like to _be those people_, not just
_lean_ on them. Also, I'm like, super interested in this stuff! That's
ultimately why I do it!

There are so many ways to access this information, from online lectures on
youtube to coursera courses to books to forums... many sources that I've
availed myself of before, but I'll have to be more consistent and controlled if
I want to truly fill in the gaps, not just study whatever occurs to me in
relation to whatever I'm working on (not that there's anything wrong with that
of course!)

The other area that I need some serious halp with is math. I _suck_ at math.
The only reason for this deficit is that I basically haven't done it since high
school, and let's just say I didn't have engaging math classes back then. In theory,
I _love_ math!
[Bert](http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/a39171/dramatic-mens-makeover-haircut/)
and I even had a textbook reading club last year that we managed to keep going
for multiple weeks! But it's _hard_ to learn really general, rudimentary abstract things
when that _fun project_ is sitting in the back of your mind, especially
when `$FUN_PROJECT` also teaches you a ton of things!
[James](https://twitter.com/_jak) gave us a _killer_ booklist though, and even
though it might take me multiple years to get through it, having a defined path
to follow is a godsend for this kind of learning for me.

Speaking of books...

Read more dammit.
-----------------

And stop pretending the internet counts, because it doesn't. I've got a ton of
books on my shelf that I've been putting off, and I'm going to read them,
dammit.

Take my health seriously.
------------------------

Look I know this is pretty quotidien but let's all lose those 50 pounds we've been
carrying around, all right? And drink less, and eat better, and sleep better,
and meditate more, and generally not treat my body like shit.

Think deeply and carefully about how I want to consume and be consumed by media
-------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I really want to take in the world? What do I really want to read to get
my news? Who do I want to maintain relationships with in the world and online?
There are a lot of nasty defaults to these questions if you don't really
consider them. Do I really need to be facebook friends with that OKCupid date
from 2009? What value does maintaining that relationship really add to my life?
Do I really want to keep a facebook tab open all the time where I am at
continual risk of being tricked into clicking some dumbfuck slideshow link
because my lizard brain wants to see `$FEMALE_CELEB` in a tank top? What the fuck
even _is_ facebook, and twitter? Who _are_ these people?

These websites and others like them have the potential to add _real value_ to
my life, and have. They've kept me connected to or at least abrest of the lives of
many people I know and care about, and made it possible to have meaningful
interactions with [people I really look up
to](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/727148389930954754), it's true.
[Infosuicide](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-commit-infosuicide) is a
lovely, dark and deep idea. But baby and bathwater etc.

I don't have to go nuclear to rethink how I interact with these services. I
don't have to remain logged into them and carry their ad tracking cookies
around with me to every website I visit. I don't have to share a curated
version of my life on them and read about others' all the time, and I don't
intend to default to those things anymore.

This belongs to a wider category of things that I want to be more conscientious
about this year. This is the year I want to learn cryptography in earnest (see
above re: CS fundamentals) and decide if PGP encryption is a thing I want to
use. This is the year that I consider setting up a personal VPN and maybe using
Tor and Signal. This is the year that I stop being complacent about how I'm
tracked and surveilled in all aspects of my online life.

Clean up my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jfo/dotfiles)
--------------------

Yeah, sure, that deserves it's own top level header.

Rust is awesome and I'm going to continue to learn it!
-------------------------------------------

I've really enjoyed working with Rust in the past few months, and the community
has been remarkably welcoming. It's a challenging language, but there is a lot
of really good work in there, and so much to learn.

A real blog redesign.
---------------------

Someone on reddit pointed out how bad this blog looks on an android device.
Having recently switched to android myself, I wholeheartedly concur. This plus
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) upgrading with breaking changes (pinning
me to the version I started with) means I might be looking at another
port. This may or may not involve writing my own static site generator.

I've been thinking about a real redesign for a while but I am not sure what I
want to do with it yet, visually. I definitely want it to stay super simple,
but I also want it to be easier to add photos without commiting them. This
might mean a Digital Ocean or AWS host for static assets, but again that likely
would require my own static site generator.

More blogging, but less blogging?
---------------------

I want to continue to write here. I've been really pleased with the positive
impact working on this has had in my life. But I don't see myself writing as
much as I did last year. I haven't decided if I want to like do one post a
month at least or something? Or maybe write more often but shorter posts? Or
write more thot-leder things? I don't know yet! I have a few drafts sitting
around, but nothing very intricate.

Coda
====

2016 was a really great year for me, when I really think about it. It was also,
for a variety of reasons, super fucking stressful. 2017 will likely not abate
that.

The common thread running through all of the aspirations I've listed here is
_intention_. I want to learn how to be more controlled and intentional with how
I spend my time and what I do with it. I want to work harder and better, but
less. I want to make space for the things and people that really matter to me
and ruthlessly cut out the rest, and I want to give deep thought to what and
who those things and people are.

I guess that's my New Year's resolution, then.

2017 is going to be a really interesting year.
